The kuisi, also known as the gaita colombiana, is a traditional indigenous flute from Colombia’s Caribbean coast. Crafted from cactus, beeswax, and feathers, this ancient instrument is more than just wood and breath — it is a vessel of memory, spirit, and resistance.

Born from the wisdom of the Kogi, Arhuaco, and Wayuu peoples, the kuisi channels the voice of nature: the wind, the birds, the rivers. It comes in two types — kuisi bunsi (female) and kuisi sigi (male) — always played together, symbolizing balance, unity, and harmony.

In cumbia and other Afro-Indigenous rhythms, the kuisi carries the soul of a people whose stories have long been sung through its haunting melodies. It doesn’t just play notes — it weaves centuries of tradition, identity, and resilience into every sound. Today, artists and cultural guardians breathe new life into the kuisi, ensuring its voice continues to inspire, heal, and awaken those who listen.
