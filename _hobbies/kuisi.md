The kuisi, also known as the gaita colombiana, is a traditional indigenous flute from Colombia’s Caribbean coast. Crafted from cactus, beeswax, and feathers, this ancient instrument is more than just wood and breath — it is a vessel of memory, spirit, and resistance.

Born from the wisdom of the Kogi, Arhuaco, and Wayuu peoples, the kuisi channels the voice of nature: the wind, the birds, the rivers. It comes in two types — kuisi bunsi (female) and kuisi sigi (male) — always played together, symbolizing balance, unity, and harmony.

In cumbia and other Afro-Indigenous rhythms, the kuisi carries the soul of a people whose stories have long been sung through its haunting melodies. It doesn’t just play notes — it weaves centuries of tradition, identity, and resilience into every sound. Today, artists and cultural guardians breathe new life into the kuisi, ensuring its voice continues to inspire, heal, and awaken those who listen.

Device working principle
======
The GFNUN Compton Camera consists of an array of two detectors set up in a coincidence configuration. The backscattering detector is shaped like a hollow cylinder, with a lead shielding containing a ^22^Na radioactive source located within the hole. This detector is made of a CsI crystal coupled to two photomultipliers. The position detector, on the other hand, is a CsI crystal with a special photomultiplier that allows for the current generated to be divided into a 64x64 pixel grid. The working principle of the camera is the following:

<br/><img src='/assets/images/research/compton/setup.png'>

1. A beta decay occurs inside the source, producing an electron-positron pair that annihilates and creates a pair of 511 keV photons. These photons travel in opposite directions.

2. One photon travels towards the position detector while the other travels towards the sample.
