I am a PhD researcher at the [Argelander-Institut f√ºr Astronomie](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en/institute) at the University of Bonn. My research focuses on observational cosmology, specifically on studying the large-scale structure of the universe using weak gravitational lensing. I am dedicated to developing cutting-edge machine learning techniques and statistical tools that can provide more accurate and unbiased estimates, which are essential for gaining insights into the nature of cosmological tensions.

I hold a Master's degree in physics from Universidade Estadual de Campinas (2019), and a Bachelor's degree in Physics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia (2017). You can find a (probably old) copy of my CV [here](https://andalenavals.github.io/files/academic_cv.pdf).
