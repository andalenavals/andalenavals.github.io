I was born in Aguachica, a small town in the south caribean region of Colombia, it is not a particular famous place, except for being the fist city in Colombia where a [peace referendum](https://web.comisiondelaverdad.co/actualidad/blogs/aguachica-25-anos-de-una-apuesta-por-la-vida-y-la-paz) was carried out.

but if you plan to visit, I higly recommend you to bring a mosquito repellent and only take a "mototaxi" if you are a fan of extreme "sports". There is a nice traditional music festival, and people is super warm, kind and full of artists  will tell you fantastic stories-->

My interest for phyiscs started in higschool watching some episodes of the series The mechanical Universe and Cosmos. But the feeling went deeper reading a book of introduction to physics that my two years older brother gave me because he was finished the first semester at University.  <!--- it is "Física general : con experimentos sencillos" by Antônio Máximo and Beatriz Alvarenga -->

Moving to Bogota (la nevera) at age 17 was the most extreme change of enviroment I have ever done. I was living for the first time by my own, far from my family, in a complete strange, big, noisy, gray, cold, rainy city where the slogan "2600 meters closer to the stars" just meant getting tired goin up stairs to my room, and that I will go peeing three times more time than usual. Fortunatly, I was admited to the Universidad Nacioanl At that moment, I had an utopical image of the Universidad Nacional


Fortunatly, I was living close to the Universty and I did not suffer the traffic. 

but also because there were not anymore small streets with almost no cars, 

Probably the most challenging change of enveironment was to move to from my home town to the capital una ciudad gris una ciudad cenicienta, la sensacion del frijo y la dificultad para respirar, 

At age 17, after finishing high school, I moved to Bogotá pursuing a Bachelor in physics at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia

Before moving to Germany in 2021, I was living for three years in Brazil, where I got a Master's degree in Physics from the Universidade Estadual de Campinas,
