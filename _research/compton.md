To observe the inside of an object, we require high-energy photons such as X-rays and gamma radiation. Typically, imaging using X-rays or gamma radiation involves positioning the target between the radiation source and the detector. However, in many cases, it is not feasible to place the detector in the opposite direction to the source. Examples of such situations include detecting or imaging buried objects such as landmines, the inner side of pipes or walls, and others. The Compton Camera is a deviced developed by researchers in Bogot√° and Darmstadt and lead by the Nuclear physics group of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia [GFNUN](http://gfnun.unal.edu.co), which uses backscattered gamma photons to produce images.


Compton Camera
======
The GFNUN Compton Camera consists of an array of two detectors set up in a coincidence configuration. The backscattering detector is shaped like a hollow cylinder, with a lead shielding containing a ^{22}Na radioactive source located within the hole. This detector is made of a CsI crystal coupled to two photomultipliers. The position detector, on the other hand, is a CsI crystal with a special photomultiplier that allows for the current generated to be divided into a 64x64 pixel grid. The working principle of the camera is the following:
