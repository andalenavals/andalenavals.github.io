To observe the inside of an object, we require high-energy photons such as X-rays and gamma radiation. Typically, imaging using X-rays or gamma radiation involves positioning the target between the radiation source and the detector. However, in many cases, it is not feasible to place the detector in the opposite direction to the source. Examples of such situations include detecting or imaging buried objects such as landmines, the inner side of pipes or walls, and others. The Compton Camera is a deviced developed by researchers in Bogot√° and Darmstadt and lead by the Nuclear physics group of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia [GFNUN](http://gfnun.unal.edu.co), which uses backscattered gamma photons to produce images.
