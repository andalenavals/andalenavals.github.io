To observe the inside of an object, we require high-energy photons such as X-rays and gamma radiation. Typically, imaging using X-rays or gamma radiation involves positioning the target between the radiation source and the detector. However, in many cases, it is not feasible to place the detector in the opposite direction to the source. Examples of such situations include detecting or imaging buried objects such as landmines, the inner side of pipes or walls, and others. The Compton Camera is a deviced developed by researchers in Bogot√° and Darmstadt and lead by the Nuclear physics group of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia [GFNUN](http://gfnun.unal.edu.co), which uses backscattered gamma photons to produce images.


Device working principle
======
The GFNUN Compton Camera consists of an array of two detectors set up in a coincidence configuration. The backscattering detector is shaped like a hollow cylinder, with a lead shielding containing a ^{22}Na radioactive source located within the hole. This detector is made of a CsI crystal coupled to two photomultipliers. The position detector, on the other hand, is a CsI crystal with a special photomultiplier that allows for the current generated to be divided into a 64x64 pixel grid. The working principle of the camera is the following:



1. A beta decay occurs inside the source, producing an electron-positron pair that annihilates and creates a pair of 511 keV photons. These photons travel in opposite directions.

2. One photon travels towards the position detector while the other travels towards the sample.

3. The photon traveling towards the sample may undergo one or multiple backscattering events with the sample or its surroundings, eventually reaching the backscattering detector.

4. Once the backscattering detector registers the backscattered photon, the position detector saves the position (adding one count to the pixel) of the first photon that traveled towards it. A time window is fine-tuned to allow for "waiting for the signal", and if no photons arrive at the backscattering detector, no pixels will be filled in the position detector.

5. This process is repeated for several photons. Due to the spatial distribution of the sample, differences in materials (primarily densities), and energies, an image is created as a result of the difference in the probability of the photons being scattered.
