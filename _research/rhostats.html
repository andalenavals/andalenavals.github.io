Rho-statistics are two point correlation function of residual errors of the Point Spread Function (PSF) modeling. Stars are point source, the images we get from stars are actually a representation of the PSF, therefore we can use images of stars for modelling the PSF. The PSF have two main contributions the optics of the telescope and the atmosphere smearing, it is position and wavelength dependent. The PSF needs to be interpolated to galaxy position, this interpolation might introduce errors given the variance of the PSF accross the field of view. To study systematic biases that might arise from the interpolation scheme a set of stars is left out from the PSF modeling, then comparing the shape measurements of those reserved stars with the expected shape using the interpolation scheme we can obtain residual of the PSF that will help to indefity problematics sources, exposures or regions where the PSF systematics are above the requerimenst, as well as we can use them as building blocks of PSF residual point correlation functions which can be propagate in the likelihood analysis to study consequences in final cosmological estimates.
