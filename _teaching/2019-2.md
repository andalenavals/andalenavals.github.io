This course cover basic topics in nuclear physics, this includes basic properties of the nuclei like the radii, mass, binding energies. Later nuclear forces are introduced as well as consevation laws, charge independence and isospin. Then the liquid-drop model is introduced and basic concepts of reactions such as cross section, differential cross section. Closing with Nuclear decays.
