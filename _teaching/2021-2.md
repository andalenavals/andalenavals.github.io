Description
======
The lab course consists of two parts. First, the data reduction of a lensed quasar to obtain a final estimate of the Hubble constant. Second, the observation of a transit using AIfA (telescope)[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en/students/teleskop] to determine the radius of the planet. In case of bad weather, the lab will perform the characterization of the AIfA camera, measure the dark current and gain, and determine the full-well capacity.

Data reduction
======
For this part of the experiment, all the science and calibration frames were obtained using the Enzian Camera at the (Hoher List)[https://www.hoher-list.de/instrumentarium/] 1m telescope. It consists of a lensed quasar for which we want to measure the time delay. The first step of this part is to reduce the images, which means applying bias, dark, and flat field corrections, and creating a coadded science frame. Then, a PSF model is created using stars in the coadd. After that, a multicomponent fitting is applied to the lensed system using galfit, which ultimately leads to obtaining light curves that can be used to determine the time delay and, consequently, the Hubble constant.
